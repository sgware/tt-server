/**
 * A client connects to a {@link Server server} to find a partner and play a
 * {@link Role role} in a storytelling {@link Session session}.
 * <p>
 * This abstract class implements the necessary communication protocol to
 * connect to the server, find a partner, and start a session. Each time a
 * {@link Status status update} arrives from the server that requires this
 * client to make a choice, the {@link #onChoice(Status)} method is called to
 * determine what choice the agent wants to make.
 * <p>
 * This class provides several other methods that are all called from the same
 * thread at important moments in the client's lifecycle. These methods can be
 * overridden to, for example, log important information or update the client's
 * world model. See the {@link #call()} method for a full description of these
 * methods and when they are called.
 * <p>
 * If the session begins and ends normally the client's {@link #call()} method
 * returns the session ID of the completed session. If this client disconnects
 * early, or if a problem occurs that does not cause an uncaught exception, that
 * method will return null.

	 * <li>After the client receives the {@link Connect connect} message from
	 * the server, {@link #onConnect(Connect)} is called. This is the client's
	 * last chance to make changes to its identity or session details.</li>
	 * <li>After the client receives the {@link Start start} message and the
	 * first {@link Update update} message, the session begins and the {@link
	 * #onStart(World, Role, State)} method is called. Immediately before that
	 * method is called, method like {@link #getWorld()} will be able to return
	 * their values.</li>
	 * <li>Each time the client receives an {@link Update update} message, the
	 * {@link #onUpdate(Status)} method is called to notify the client about
	 * changes to the session history and world state. This method is called
	 * whether or not the client need to make a choice.</li>
	 * <li>Each time the client receives an {@link Update update} message and it
	 * is the client's turn to act, after calling {@link #onUpdate(Status)} the
	 * {@link #onChoice(Status)} method will be called to solicit which turn the
	 * client wants to take. After calling that method, the {@link
	 * #getChoices()} method will return an empty list.</li>
	 * <li>If the session's story reaches one of its pre-defined endings, the
	 * {@link #onEnd(Ending)} method will be called.</li>
	 * <li>If the session ended because this client was {@link #close() closed},
	 * because the client thread was interrupted, or because the socket was
	 * disconnected, the {@link #onClose()} method will be called. If an
	 * exception was thrown earlier in this method, {@link #onClose()} will not
	 * be called.</li>
	 * <li>If the session started, the {@link #onStop(String)} method will
	 * always be called before this method returns or throw an exception.</li>
