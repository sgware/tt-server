/**
 * A client factory creates continuously creates {@link Client clients} to
 * connect to a {@link Server server} and is useful for deploying automated
 * agents.
 * <p>
 * A factory starts by creating one client to join the server's queue of waiting
 * players. When that client finds a partner and starts its session, the factory
 * creates a new client to take its place in the queue.
 * <p>
 * You can limit the {@link #maxClients maximum number of clients} this factory
 * will run simultaneously.
 * <p>
 * If any client created by this factory throws an uncaught exception, this
 * factory will shut down gracefully and throw that exception after shutting
 * down.
 * <p>
 * This class provides several methods that are all called from the same thread
 * at important moments in the factory's lifecycle. These methods can be
 * overridden to, for example, log important information. See the {@link
 * #call()} method for a full description of these methods and when they are
 * called.

	 * {@inheritDoc}
	 * <p>
	 * This method starts the client factory, creates the first client,
	 * periodically creates new clients as needed, and shuts down gracefully
	 * if the factory is closed or if a client throw an uncaught exception.
	 * <p>
	 * As this method runs, it calls other methods to notify the factory of
	 * important events. Some of these methods are guaranteed to be called even
	 * if an exception is thrown. The list of those methods and when they happen
	 * is as follows:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>The {@link #onStart()} method is called first. If this method throws
	 * an exception it is thrown immediately, and no other methods are called.
	 * </li>
	 * <li>The first client is created and {@link Client#call() runs} on a new
	 * virtual thread.</li>
	 * <li>Each time a client starts its session, a new client will be created
	 * to take its place in the server's queue of waiting clients. If creating a
	 * new client would exceed this factory's {@link #maxClients limit} on the
	 * number of clients which can run simultaneously, this factory will wait
	 * until a running client has completed its session to start the next
	 * client.</li>
	 * <li>If one of the clients created by this factory throws an exception, or
	 * if the {@link #close()} method is called, the {@link #onClose()} method
	 * will run on the thread which called this method, regardless of which
	 * thread called {@link #close()}. If the thread which called this method
	 * is interrupted, {@link #onClose()} will not be called.</li>
	 * <li>Any clients whose sessions have not yet begun will be {@link
	 * Client#close() closed}. Clients whose sessions have begun will not be
	 * closed. If this factory stopped because of an exception or because the
	 * {@link #close()} method was called, it will wait for all clients whose
	 * sessions have started to finish. If this factory stopped because the
	 * thread which called this method was interrupted, it will not wait for
	 * running clients to finish their sessions.</li>
	 * <li>After all running clients have finished their sessions, {@link
	 * #onStop()} is called. If this factory stopped because the thread which
	 * called this method was interrupted, that method will not be called.</li>
	 * <li>If a client threw an exception, that exception will be thrown from
	 * this method. If no exception was thrown, this method returns null.</li>
	 * </ul>
